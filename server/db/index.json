            "Description":	"WN18RR is a link prediction dataset created from WN18, which is a subset of WordNet. WN18 consists of 18 relations and 40,943 entities. However, many text triples are obtained by inverting triples from the training set. Thus the WN18RR dataset is created to ensure that the evaluation dataset does not have inverse relation test leakage. In summary, WN18RR dataset contains 93,003 triples with 40,943 entities and 11 relation types. [https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wn18rr]",

In total, YAGO3-10 has 123,182 entities and 37 relations, and most of the triples describe attributes of persons such as citizenship, gender, and profession.
